# 🌍 AstroSync

**AstroSync** is a cosmic web app that lets you discover the Earth's position in its orbit on your birthday — and matches it with the corresponding position in the current year.  
Inspired by a concept mentioned by **Neil deGrasse Tyson** on his podcast, AstroSync brings astronomy and birthdays together in a unique and interactive way.

🧠 Inspiration
This project was sparked by an idea shared by Neil deGrasse Tyson during one of his podcast episodes. He explained how our real "cosmic birthday" is when the Earth returns to the same point in its orbit — not just the date on the calendar. That inspired this app.
