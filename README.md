# AstroSync
AstroSync is a web and mobile app that calculates Earth’s exact position in its orbit on a user’s birthdate and maps it to the current year, revealing their "astrological birthday." Using APIs like NASA’s JPL Horizons for real-time planetary data, it visualizes orbital paths with interactive diagrams.
